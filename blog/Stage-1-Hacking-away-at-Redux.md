# Stage one
So far so good. React, Redux and Router seems to work really well together. However, getting started with Redux hasn't been the easiest. All these new way of doing stuff -- mindboggling.

I think I have it covered now, with my app for this course -- **Contacts**. As the name suggests, my goal is to have some sort of contact list, where you can save and view contacts easily. Maybe I will even tread into the realm of Firebase? Who knows.

## Problems
The problems I have encountered with getting started have been varied. Sometimes it's a missing semicolon that messes up the whole application, and sometimes it is a misunderstanding of how to handle the different moving parts, such as props and state so that React knows that things have changed a rerenders the UI.

I'm also working on trying to hack together some features for the guild, such as ordering on the Roster-page. That feature is coming along, but it doesn't seem to work for the PR's for some reason. *Odd*.
