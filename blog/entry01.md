# Introduction
My name is Christoffer. I live in Falun, Sweden with my girlfriend and my dog, Cosmos. Currently I work at a warehouse that distributes books all over Sweden, and I also try to study with the time I have left.

## "Webbiness"
Since I have studied the program Webprogramming on Linneaus University before starting this continuation year, I have a bit of experience with webprogramming before. You can never have enough experience, but the Webprogramming program was two years long so some experience I must have, right?

## Development environment
I mostly use Webstorm for Javascript programming since that gives you a lot of stuff for free, such as file handling, git integration, code completion and more. For other languages I use Jetbrains other products, since you can use them for free when you are a student. If I want to do something small I might just use Sublime Text instead.

## Hopes and goals
I don't know if I have any hopes or goals, really. I'm almost 3 weeks late into this course, which means that I will have a really hard time finishing it, but I will do my best. So my goal would be to finish the course without getting an F.
